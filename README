In order to run the software, one need miniconda installed :
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers

and then install the librairies as stated in lardenv.yml : 
conda env create -f lardenv.yml
[It'll take about 2-3 GB!]

then :
conda activate lardenv

To run lardon on data : 
python reader.py -run <run nb> -sub <subfile name> -n <nb of events (optional)> -out <output file option>
e.g. : python reader.py -run 1415 -sub 1_a -n 10 -out example
Check config.py file to set numbers of CRP to be read (2 or 4 if CRP3 took data) and set the eventual problematic channels

To run lardon on MC : 
add -mc <the MC root file to be read>
the simulation will be added to a run of data (preferably a noise run!)
