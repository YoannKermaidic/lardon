GENERAL
* * * * *

- Set running options 
  Like -i [file] -n [nb of events] etc

- Channel Channel Mapper for runs <= xxx (I think some cables misplugged at some point)
- Signal Polarity inversion for runs < 1256

- Take closest reference pedestal

- Check event header of v0 and v1 are the same, and merge : DONE

- Improve on reading the run & event header (-> through numpy and not struct.unpack) : DONE

- Results storage ? ROOT ?

ANALYSIS
* * * * *

- pedestal wave to be removed : sliced poly fit ? FFT ? 
- ROI/hit found : fit it ?
- Track finder
