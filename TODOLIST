GENERAL
* * * * *

- reconstruction parameters and run specific things (e.g. broken channel) written in an input file (+ have default values defined somewhere) : json file ?
  + values to be stored in the output file (e.g. in ./infos table)

- mc file reader (to be produced as well!)
  + module to add noise (?)

ANALYSIS
* * * * *
- microphonic noise : FFT2D ? FFT ? Keep it like that ?
- Fit Hits ? 
- 2D track finder : once found, refilter in forward and backward ?
- Track stitching : add special care to LEM (+CRP) borders ?
- light and crt reader
