- reconstruction parameters and run specific things (e.g. broken channel) written in an input file (+ have default values defined somewhere) : json file ?
  + values to be stored in the output file (e.g. in ./infos table)

- improve dray finder

- take into account gaps between CRPs

- improve 3D matching (broken tracks in one view) 

- improve view extrapolation at 3D level

- separate dQ and ds at storing level (for future field correction) ?

- improve track timing reconstruction, in particular with off channels
